# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Pretendard
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-Black.otf
          weight: 900
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-ExtraBold.otf
          weight: 800
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-Bold.otf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-SemiBold.otf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-Medium.otf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-Regular.otf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-Light.otf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-ExtraLight.otf
          weight: 200
